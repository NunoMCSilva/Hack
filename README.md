# Hack Emulator

Hack is the 16-bit computer built in the "From Nand to
Tetris" course (https://www.nand2tetris.org/).

This is my quick attempt at an pure python Hack emulator.
It was written for learning purposes: both for the
Nand2Tetris course and as a simple project to learn about
emulation.

It's still a work in progress.
